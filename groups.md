# Learn how groups
For good collaboration, of course, users are needed. The more open and transparent the communication, the better the results can be. However, it is also perfectly clear that not all users should be allowed or able to do everything. For this reason, detective also has a user and group concept, which is important to understand in order to specifically enable masks and potential release processes.

### Prerequisites
In order to make changes, the following points must be true:
1. Your account need administrator rights to your detective instance. If you created the detective instance you will have the admin rights by default. If you don't have admin rights ask your admin to change the subscription or ask the admin to upgrade your permissions in the [User](./users) section
2. You need to be logged in to [detective](https://detective.solutions/login).

You will find both `User` and `Groups` in your Admin section which you can reach by clicking on the `Admin` button on the left bottom corner.
Both `User` and `Groups` have a seperate section since you might want to check or modify a user independend from the groups he might be assigned to and vice versa.
